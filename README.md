# ðŸ“˜ C Academic Exercises ðŸ“˜

This repository contains practical programming exercises in C developed throughout my **Information Systems** degree at **UFMS CPTL**. The goal of this repository is to consolidate fundamental concepts of the C language and best development practices, while also serving as a portfolio for continuous learning in the programming field.

## ðŸ“‚ Content

The repository is organized into topics that cover different aspects of the C language, including:

- **C Language Fundamentals**: Basic syntax, data types, operators, control structures, and loops.
- **Functions and Modularization**: Defining and using functions, passing parameters, recursion, and organizing code modularly.
- **Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Manipulating pointers, memory allocation and deallocation with `malloc`, `free`, and others.
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing files, both text and binary.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing and manipulating structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

To start using the exercises in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local environment:
